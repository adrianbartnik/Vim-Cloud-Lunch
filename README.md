# Vim Cloudlunch

This repository contains a default `.vimrc` config file and the workshop instructions.

## Getting Started

Copy the `.vimrc` file to your home directory.

**Warning:** If you already have a `.vimrc` file, either make a backup of that file or skip this step.

```shell
cp .vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

Afterwards, open the workshop instructions by executing:

```shell
vim VimCloudLunch.md
```
